These are various configuration and customization files/scripts for my 
environments.

install.sh is meant to handle the set up process.
  -It symlinks the conf files to their proper locations
  -it backs up previous configs to *.bak

The bin/ scripts have "atu-" prepended to them so it is easy to find them in path. "atu-<TAB><TAB>"

  HA! go home, you're drunk.
